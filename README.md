# Bluetooth Scouting App, FRC 2018

_(currently still in development)_

At FIRST Robotics Competition events, teams usually scout matches that other teams play to find potential alliance partners. Electronic scouting records are simply easier to perform statistical analysis on than paper records, but at most events, Wi-Fi hotspots are prohibited. This means you can't use Google Drive or a custom website unless you want to depend on expensive data plans or have all the scouts work on one computer. Thus, you need to use different communication protocols.

This app (is currently in the process of supporting) electronic multi-client match scouting and will support pit scouting (eventually).

For match scouting, this app supports:

- Bluetooth 
- IPC (so that you can use the same phone/tablet as a server and as a client)

For pit scouting, this app will support:

- Bluetooth 
- NFC
